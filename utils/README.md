# Utils for the ePed website with instructions

This directory contains some utilities related to the ePEd website with
instructions.

 * [ePedExtractLinksi.vbs](ePedExtractLinks.vbs) is a VisualBasic script for
   downloading all instructions on the ePed website to a local directory. This
   could be useful for local health care units to run on a schedule to ensure
   that they have local copies of all instructions in case they loose access
   to the ePed website.
 * [get\_PDF\_ePed.bat](get_PDF_ePEd.bat) is a one line Windows BAT script
   which simply invokes the VisualBasic script above.
